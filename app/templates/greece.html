            <p><strong>Day One:</strong> May 9-10, 2025 Miami to Athens: After a ten and a half-hour flight we arrived in Athens. Once we received out bags and cleared customs we got into a taxi driven by Nikkos who expertly drove us into the city center. This trip was quite an experience around the tiny streets, lined on both sides with parked cars. Let’s just say that we are going to be extra careful walking about the city because over here pedestrians don’t seem to have the right-of-way.  We arrived at our hotel around noon, an amazing spot with a sidewalk cafe on a sycamore lined street. After checking in and a quick nap we headed out to explore. The weather was perfect and we walked around the Acropolis taking in the many sidewalk performers that were out Saturday afternoon. We found a rooftop cafe and sampled some greek cuisine. I was not 100% but the grilled octopus they served quickly revived me. Once we had eaten we headed out to shop, there were many shops close by and we enjoyed seeing all that they had to offer. We closed the night out with dinner at the Sense restaurant at the top of the hotel. The menu was a chef’s tasting and was an amazing offering of local flavors and presentations. We dined and watched the sunset on the Parthenon.
